# Hilichurls-Detection-in-Genshin-Impact

Some of the inspirations I suddenly came across while working on SURF projects. Since YOLOv8 supports custom datasets, I hope it can recognize Hilichurls in Genshin Impact. So there was this project. In the future, the automatic attack module will be updated to enable the entire program to automatically control the mouse and keyboard to attack enemies.
