# Hilichurls-Detection-in-Genshin-Impact

Some of the inspirations I suddenly came across while working on SURF projects. Since YOLOv8 supports custom datasets, I hope it can recognize Hilichurls in Genshin Impact. So I made this project with the existing model used in the SURF project(https://github.com/NomotoK/Computer-Vision-Based-Traffic-Accident-Detection). 

## Functions
- Detect enemies(currently Hilichurls only)


In the future, I hope to add an automatic attack module to enable the entire program, with the ability to automatically control the mouse and keyboard to attack enemies.
